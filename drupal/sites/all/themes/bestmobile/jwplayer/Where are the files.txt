You need to download JW Player: http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player
and WhoTube skin for it: http://www.longtailvideo.com/addons/skins/183/WhoTube.
Before you download JW Player, make sure to uncheck "Include Viral, a video sharing plugin".
I couldn't attach it due its license limitations.

Put JW Player and the skin in data/jwplayer folder. Make sure, skin remains in it's separate folder, so as a result you get this kind of paths to crucial files:
data/jwplayer/jwplayer.js
data/jwplayer/whutube/whotube.xml
